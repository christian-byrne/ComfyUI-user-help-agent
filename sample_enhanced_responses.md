"Request specific details about the problem, error messages, system info, and steps to reproduce"

**AFTER:**
```markdown
Hi @username! To help debug this issue effectively, could you please provide the following information:

## System Information
- Operating System (Windows/macOS/Linux + version)
- Python version (`python --version`)
- ComfyUI version/commit hash
- GPU information and VRAM amount
- Available system RAM

## Error Details
- Complete error logs from the console (please paste the full traceback)
- Screenshots of any error dialogs
- The exact steps that trigger the issue
- When did this issue first start occurring?

## Workflow Information
- Upload the workflow file (.json) or paste the workflow as text
- List any custom nodes being used

- Are you using any specific settings or configurations?

## Quick Collection Tips
You can quickly gather system information using:
- ComfyUI Manager's "System Info" feature (Manager ‚Üí Install ‚Üí System Info)
- For command line users: include output from `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA GPUs) or `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` (macOS)

### Issue #8385 - Package Mirror Propagation
**BEFORE:**
"Explain package mirror propagation delay and suggest waiting or using newer version"

**AFTER:**
```markdown
This appears to be related to package mirror propagation delays. When packages are updated on PyPI, it can take several hours for all mirrors worldwide to sync the new version.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)
- Try again in 2-4 hours as mirrors propagate
- Package availability varies by geographic region
- Peak hours may have additional delays

### Option 2: Force Refresh
```bash
# Clear pip cache and reinstall
pip cache purge
pip install --no-cache-dir package-name
```

### Option 3: Use Primary Index
```bash
# Bypass mirrors and use main PyPI
pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ package-name
```

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Install from Source
```bash
# For most packages, install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/repo/package.git
```

### Use Conda/Mamba (Often More Stable)
```bash
# Try conda-forge channel
conda install -c conda-forge package-name
# Or using mamba for faster resolution
mamba install -c conda-forge package-name
```

## System-Specific Troubleshooting

**Windows Users:**
- Windows Defender sometimes interferes with downloads
- Try running command prompt as administrator
- Check if corporate firewall is blocking PyPI

**macOS Users:**
- Update pip first: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- For Apple Silicon, ensure you're using arm64-compatible packages
- Check Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`

**Linux Users:**
- Ensure proper permissions for Python environment
- Check if package manager conflicts exist
- Try using virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
