## Key Indicators
- User provided screenshot showing blank preview node
- KSampler preview works correctly (important differential)
- Custom nodes testing completed (issue persists)
- No error logs provided in submission
- Empty logs section in issue template
- Visual evidence but no diagnostic information

## Reasoning
User provided good initial information (screenshot, custom node testing) but crucial technical details are missing. The differential between working KSampler preview and non-working Preview node suggests a frontend rendering issue rather than core workflow/generation problem. Requires browser console logs, ComfyUI console output, and system specifications to diagnose effectively.

## Similar Issues Found
- #2323: Similar preview display issue (resolved with browser cache clearing)
- #3523: KSampler preview crashes (different but related preview issue)
- #3600: Preview breaking with command line flags

## Response Strategy
Focus on information gathering for browser/frontend troubleshooting:
1. Browser console logs (primary diagnostic need)
2. System information collection
3. Browser-specific quick fixes
4. Minimal reproduction workflow
